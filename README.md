Today, we are testing one of the simplest and most famous trading strategies involving moving averages. We will be using a daily timeframe and updating our positions at the market open (to avoid gap prices).

The first strategy is straightforward: we choose a moving average period, usually between 150 and 250 days. If the current market open price is above the moving average, we enter the market; otherwise, we stay out.

The second strategy is slightly more complex. We use two different moving averages: a “fast” one, typically between 25 and 100 days, and a “slow” one, again between 150 and 250 days. We enter the market when the fast moving average crosses above the slow moving average, and we exit when it crosses back below.

Backtests performed on various indexes (MSCI World, CAC 40, S&P 500, etc.) show that the simple moving average strategy produces strong results. It either slightly underperforms while achieving a much better maximum drawdown, or it outperforms while still maintaining a lower maximum drawdown.

Other metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio or the Calmar ratio, could also be calculated, but here we focus on the basics. The backtests also show that the more complex strategy consistently underperforms. In some cases, it even accentuates the maximum drawdown.

This approach can also be applied to forex pairs (e.g., EUR/USD). In forex, a simple “buy-and-hold” strategy is rarely used by traders. However, this moving average strategy tends not to outperform already highly volatile assets. For stocks like NVDA, MSFT, and AAPL, it consistently underperforms a simple buy-and-hold strategy.
